# Introduction to OOP

## Objective
Understand the basic principles of OOP (classes, objects, attributes, methods).

## Exercises
1. Read, summarize, and learn the **4 pillars of OOP**: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

- **Encapsulation:** Hiding the internal state and functionality of a class while allowing access only through public properties and methods.  
- **Abstraction:** A simplified representation of an entity that isolates an element from its context or implementation, emphasizing *"what it does"* rather than *"how it does it"*.  
- **Inheritance:** The ability to create new classes that extend and modify the behavior of existing **base** classes.  
- **Polymorphism:** The ability to send syntactically identical messages to classes of different natures through interfaces.  

2. Create a `Person` class in C# with attributes (`name`, `age`) and methods (`Greet()` that prints a greeting).  
3. Write a C# program that creates instances of `Person` and calls `Greet()`.
