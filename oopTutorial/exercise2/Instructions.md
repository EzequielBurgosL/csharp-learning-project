# Encapsulation and Properties

## Objective
Learn about access modifiers and properties.

## Exercises
1. Modify the `Person` class so that `name` and `age` are private and accessible only through properties (`get` and `set`).  
2. Validate in the `set` method that the age cannot be negative.  
3. Create a program that attempts to assign incorrect values and tests the validations.
